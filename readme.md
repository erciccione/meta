## What's the purpose of the 'Monero Ecosystem' project?
Many Monero related repositories are on GitHub and some are very interesting and important, but they are often uploaded on personal accounts. This limits the visibility of the repository, making contributions and maintenance much harder.
&nbsp;

The goal of the 'Monero Ecosystem' is to gather all relevant repositories in just one place, easy to find and manage for both maintainers and contributors.    
Feel free to open an issue if you have suggestions/proposals.


## Transfer your repo!
If you have a monero related repository you want to add, open an issue or contact erciccione, so we can transfer the repo to the "Monero Ecosystem" project. You'll be added as a member of the project and all permissions, commits, history will be inalterated and you will be the maintainer, with no differences from before. Please, ask to transfer a repo only if you plan to keep it updated.
